**Project Motivation**

We selected the Students Performance Dataset because student achievement is one of the most important topics in the field of education. Understanding the factors that influence academic performance can help teachers, parents, and institutions design better interventions and policies to support learners.

This dataset includes demographic information (such as gender and parental education level), lifestyle factors (such as study time, and exam scores). By analyzing these variables, we can explore how personal, social, and academic elements contribute to student success or challenges.

The goal of our project is to identify patterns and key predictors that distinguish students with high, medium, and low performance. These insights can guide educators in developing tailored strategies to improve learning outcomes, reduce failure rates, and promote equity in education.
